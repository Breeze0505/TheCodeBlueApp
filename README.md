### What is The Code Blue App?
The Code Blue App is a tool made for hospital staff to use during a code blue. This app helps them time the actions in a code blue to the American Heart Association's Â® recommendations. It is simple to use and records the data needed for hospital records.
### What is a Code Blue?
When a person experiences respiratory or cardiac failure, it is typically called a code blue. During a code blue a combination of physical, electrical, and chemical interventions are used to resuscitate the patient.
### Who Created The Code Blue App?
This app was developed by Jace Billingsley for the Congressional App Challenge 2021. His father is a respiratory therapist, and he participates in resuscitation efforts very frequently. Many times, the documentation efforts in a code blue are not as detailed and accurate as is needed. This app can assist any healthcare provider to deliver better lifesaving efforts during a code blue.
